# Movie-Recommendation-System
The Movie Recommendation System project harnesses the power of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AIML) to create a personalized movie recommendation engine. The system aims to enhance user experience by suggesting movies that align with individual preferences and viewing history.

# Objective:
A Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user's choices. Recommender systems are utilized in various areas including movies, music, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. Recommender systems produce a list of recommendations in any of two ways -
1. **Collaborative filtering:** Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from the user's past behavior and similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items that users may be interested in.
2. **Content-based filtering:** Content-based filtering approaches use a series of discrete characteristics of an item to recommend additional items with similar properties. These methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences. It recommends items based on the user's past preferences.
